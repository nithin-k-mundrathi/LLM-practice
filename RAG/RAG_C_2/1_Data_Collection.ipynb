[  ] While the exploration of space is currently carried out mainly by astronomers with telescopes , its physical exploration is conducted both by uncrewed robotic space probes and human spaceflight . Space exploration, like its classical form astronomy , is one of the main sources for space science . While the observation of objects in space, known as astronomy , predates reliable recorded history , it was the development of large and relatively efficient rockets during the mid-twentieth century that allowed physical space exploration to become a reality. Common rationales for exploring space include advancing scientific research, national prestige, uniting different nations, ensuring the future survival of humanity, and developing military and strategic advantages against other countries. [  ] The early era of space exploration was driven by a \" Space Race \" between the Soviet Union and the United States . A driving force of the start of space exploration was during the Cold War. After the ability to create nuclear weapons, the narrative of defense/offense left land and the power to control the air the focus. Both the Soviet Union and the U.S. were racing to prove their superiority in technology through exploring space. In fact, the reason NASA was created was as a response to Sputnik I. [  ] The launch of the first human-made object to orbit Earth , the Soviet Union's Sputnik  , on  October , and the first Moon landing by the American Apollo  mission on  July  are often taken as landmarks for this initial period. The Soviet space program achieved many of the first milestones, including the first living being in orbit in , the first human spaceflight ( Yuri Gagarin aboard Vostok  ) in , the first spacewalk (by Alexei Leonov ) on  March , the first automatic landing on another celestial body in , and the launch of the first space station ( Salyut  ) in . After the first  years of exploration, focus shifted from one-off flights to renewable hardware, such as the Space Shuttle program , and from competition to cooperation as with the International Space Station (ISS). With the substantial completion of the ISS [  ] following STS- in March , plans for space exploration by the U.S. remained in flux. The Constellation program aiming for a return to the Moon by  [  ] was judged unrealistic by an expert review panel reporting in . [  ] Constellation ultimately was replaced with the Artemis Program , of which the first mission occurred in  , with a planned crewed landing to occur with Artemis III . [  ] The rise of the private space industry also began in earnest in the s with the development of private launch vehicles, space capsules and satellite manufacturing. In the s, China initiated a successful crewed spaceflight program while India launched the Chandrayaan programme , while the European Union and Japan have also planned future crewed space missions. The two primary global programs gaining traction in the s are the Chinese-led International Lunar Research Station and the US-led Artemis Program, with its plan to build the Lunar Gateway and the Artemis Base Camp , each having its own set of international partners. History of exploration [ edit ] See also: History of astronomy , Discovery and exploration of the Solar System , Timeline of space exploration , Timeline of first orbital launches by country , and Outer space § Discovery V- Rocket in the Peenemünde Museum First telescopes [ edit ] The first telescope is said to have been invented in  in the Netherlands by an eyeglass maker named Hans Lippershey , but their first recorded use in astronomy was by Galileo Galilei in . [  ] In  Isaac Newton built his own reflecting telescope , the first fully functional telescope of this kind, and a landmark for future developments due to its superior features over the previous Galilean telescope . [  ] A string of discoveries in the Solar System (and beyond) followed, then and in the next centuries : the mountains of the Moon , the phases of Venus , the main satellites of Jupiter and Saturn , the rings of Saturn , many comets , the asteroids , the new planets Uranus and Neptune , and many more satellites . The Orbiting Astronomical Observatory  was the first space telescope launched , [  ] but the launching of Hubble Space Telescope in  [  ] set a milestone. As of  December , there were , confirmed exoplanets discovered. The Milky Way is estimated to contain – billion stars [  ] and more than  billion planets . [  ] There are at least  trillion galaxies in the observable universe . [  ] [  ] HD is the most distant known object from Earth, reported as . billion light-years away. [  ] [  ] [  ] [  ] [  ] [  ] First outer space flights [ edit ] Model of Vostok spacecraft Apollo Command Service Module in lunar orbit MW  was a German V- rocket test launch that took place on  June , at the Peenemünde Army Research Center in Peenemünde . It was the first human-made object to reach outer space , attaining an apogee of  kilometers, [  ] which is well above the Kármán line . [  ] It was a vertical test launch. Although the rocket reached space, it did not reach orbital velocity , and therefore returned to Earth in an impact, becoming the first sub-orbital spaceflight . [  ] In , the Bumper-WAC reached an altitude of  kilometres ( mi), becoming the first human-made object to enter space, according to NASA . [  ] First object in orbit [ edit ] The first successful orbital launch was of the Soviet uncrewed Sputnik  (\"Satellite \") mission on  October . The satellite weighed about  kg ( lb), and is believed to have orbited Earth at a height of about  km ( mi). It had two radio transmitters ( and  MHz), which emitted \"beeps\" that could be heard by radios around the globe. Analysis of the radio signals was used to gather information about the electron density of the ionosphere, while temperature and pressure data was encoded in the duration of radio beeps. The results indicated that the satellite was not punctured by a meteoroid . Sputnik  was launched by an R- rocket. It burned up upon re-entry on  January . First human outer space flight [ edit ] The first successful human spaceflight was Vostok  (\"East \"), carrying the -year-old Russian cosmonaut , Yuri Gagarin , on  April . The spacecraft completed one orbit around the globe, lasting about  hour and  minutes. Gagarin's flight resonated around the world; it was a demonstration of the advanced Soviet space program and it opened an entirely new era in space exploration: human spaceflight . First astronomical body space explorations [ edit ] The first artificial object to reach another celestial body was Luna  reaching the Moon in . [  ] The first soft landing on another celestial body was performed by Luna  landing on the Moon on  February . [  ] Luna  became the first artificial satellite of the Moon, entering in a lunar orbit on  April . [  ] The first crewed landing on another celestial body was performed by Apollo  on  July , landing on the Moon. There have been a total of six spacecraft with humans landing on the Moon starting from  to the last human landing in . The first interplanetary flyby was the  Venera  flyby of Venus , though the  Mariner  was the first flyby of Venus to return data (closest approach , kilometers). Pioneer  was the first satellite to orbit the Sun , launched on  December . The other planets were first flown by in  for Mars by Mariner  ,  for Jupiter by Pioneer  ,  for Mercury by Mariner  ,  for Saturn by Pioneer  ,  for Uranus by Voyager  ,  for Neptune by Voyager  . In , the dwarf planets Ceres and Pluto were orbited by Dawn and passed by New Horizons , respectively. This accounts for flybys of each of the eight planets in the Solar System , the Sun , the Moon , and Ceres and Pluto (two of the five recognized dwarf planets ). The first interplanetary surface mission to return at least limited surface data from another planet was the  landing of Venera  , which returned data to Earth for  minutes from Venus . In , Venera  was the first to return images from the surface of another planet, returning images from Venus. In , the Mars  mission achieved the first soft landing on Mars returning data for almost  seconds. Later, much longer duration surface missions were achieved, including over six years of Mars surface operation by Viking  from  to  and over two hours of transmission from the surface of Venus by Venera  in , the longest ever Soviet planetary surface mission. Venus and Mars are the two planets outside of Earth on which humans have conducted surface missions with uncrewed robotic spacecraft . First space station [ edit ] Salyut  was the first space station of any kind, launched into low Earth orbit by the Soviet Union on  April . The International Space Station (ISS) is currently the largest and oldest of the  current fully functional space stations, inhabited continuously since the year . The other, Tiangong space station built by China, is now fully crewed and operational. First interstellar space flight [ edit ] Voyager  became the first human-made object to leave the Solar System into interstellar space on  August . The probe passed the heliopause at  AU to enter interstellar space . [  ] Farthest from Earth [ edit ] The Apollo  flight passed the far side of the Moon at an altitude of  kilometers ( miles;  nautical miles) above the lunar surface, and , km (, mi) from Earth, marking the record for the farthest humans have ever traveled from Earth in . As of  November  [update] Voyager  was at a distance of  AU (. billion km; . billion mi) from Earth. [  ] It is the most distant human-made object from Earth. [  ] Targets of exploration [ edit ] Starting in the mid-th century probes and then human missions were sent into Earth orbit, and then on to the Moon. Also, probes were sent throughout the known Solar System, and into Solar orbit. Uncrewed spacecraft have been sent into orbit around Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Venus, and Mercury by the st century, and the most distance active spacecraft, Voyager  and  traveled beyond  times the Earth-Sun distance. The instruments were enough though that it is thought they have left the Sun's heliosphere, a sort of bubble of particles made in the Galaxy by the Sun's solar wind . The Sun [ edit ] The Sun is a major focus of space exploration. Being above the atmosphere in particular and Earth's magnetic field gives access to the solar wind and infrared and ultraviolet radiations that cannot reach Earth's surface. The Sun generates most space weather , which can affect power generation and transmission systems on Earth and interfere with, and even damage, satellites and space probes. Numerous spacecraft dedicated to observing the Sun, beginning with the Apollo Telescope Mount , have been launched and still others have had solar observation as a secondary objective. Parker Solar Probe , launched in , will approach the Sun to within /th the orbit of Mercury. Mercury [ edit ] Main article: Exploration of Mercury A MESSENGER image from , km showing a region about  km across () Mercury remains the least explored of the Terrestrial planets . As of May , the Mariner  and MESSENGER missions have been the only missions that have made close observations of Mercury. MESSENGER entered orbit around Mercury in March , to further investigate the observations made by Mariner  in  (Munsell, b). A third mission to Mercury, scheduled to arrive in , BepiColombo is to include two probes . BepiColombo is a joint mission between Japan and the European Space Agency . MESSENGER and BepiColombo are intended to gather complementary data to help scientists understand many of the mysteries discovered by Mariner 's flybys . Flights to other planets within the Solar System are accomplished at a cost in energy, which is described by the net change in velocity of the spacecraft, or delta-v . Due to the relatively high delta-v to reach Mercury and its proximity to the Sun, it is difficult to explore and orbits around it are rather unstable. Venus [ edit ] Main article: Observations and explorations of Venus Venus was the first target of interplanetary flyby and lander missions and, despite one of the most hostile surface environments in the Solar System, has had more landers sent to it (nearly all from the Soviet Union) than any other planet in the Solar System. The first flyby was the  Venera  , though the  Mariner  was the first flyby to successfully return data. Mariner  has been followed by several other flybys by multiple space agencies often as part of missions using a Venus flyby to provide a gravitational assist en route to other celestial bodies. In , Venera  became the first probe to enter and directly examine the atmosphere of Venus. In , Venera  became the first successful lander to reach the surface of Venus and by  it had been followed by eight additional successful Soviet Venus landers which provided images and other direct surface data. Starting in , with the Soviet orbiter Venera  , some ten successful orbiter missions have been sent to Venus, including later missions which were able to map the surface of Venus using radar to pierce the obscuring atmosphere. Earth [ edit ] Main article: Earth observation satellite First television image of Earth from space, taken by TIROS- () Space exploration has been used as a tool to understand Earth as a celestial object. Orbital missions can provide data for Earth that can be difficult or impossible to obtain from a purely ground-based point of reference. For example, the existence of the Van Allen radiation belts was unknown until their discovery by the United States' first artificial satellite, Explorer  . These belts contain radiation trapped by Earth's magnetic fields, which currently renders construction of habitable space stations above  km impractical. Following this early unexpected discovery, a large number of Earth observation satellites have been deployed specifically to explore Earth from a space-based perspective. These satellites have significantly contributed to the understanding of a variety of Earth-based phenomena. For instance, the hole in the ozone layer was found by an artificial satellite that was exploring Earth's atmosphere, and satellites have allowed for the discovery of archeological sites or geological formations that were difficult or impossible to otherwise identify. Moon [ edit ] Main article: Exploration of the Moon Apollo  LEM Orion, the Lunar Roving Vehicle and astronaut John Young () The Moon was the first celestial body to be the object of space exploration. It holds the distinctions of being the first remote celestial object to be flown by, orbited, and landed upon by spacecraft, and the only remote celestial object ever to be visited by humans. In , the Soviets obtained the first images of the far side of the Moon , never previously visible to humans. The U.S. exploration of the Moon began with the Ranger  impactor in . Starting in , the Soviets successfully deployed a number of landers to the Moon which were able to obtain data directly from the Moon's surface; just four months later, Surveyor  marked the debut of a successful series of U.S. landers. The Soviet uncrewed missions culminated in the Lunokhod program in the early s, which included the first uncrewed rovers and also successfully brought lunar soil samples to Earth for study. This marked the first (and to date the only) automated return of extraterrestrial soil samples to Earth. Uncrewed exploration of the Moon continues with various nations periodically deploying lunar orbiters. China's Chang'e  in  and Chang'e  in  achieved the world's first landing and sample return on the far side of the Moon . India's Chandrayaan- in  achieved the world's first landing on the lunar south pole region. Crewed exploration of the Moon began in  with the Apollo  mission that successfully orbited the Moon, the first time any extraterrestrial object was orbited by humans. In , the Apollo  mission marked the first time humans set foot upon another world. Crewed exploration of the Moon did not continue for long. The Apollo  mission in  marked the sixth landing and the most recent human visit. Artemis II is scheduled to complete a crewed flyby of the Moon in , and Artemis III will perform the first lunar landing since Apollo  with it scheduled for launch no earlier than . Robotic missions are still pursued vigorously. Mars [ edit ] Main article: Exploration of Mars Surface of Mars by the Spirit rover () The exploration of Mars has been an important part of the space exploration programs of the Soviet Union (later Russia), the United States, Europe, Japan and India. Dozens of robotic spacecraft , including orbiters , landers , and rovers , have been launched toward Mars since the s. These missions were aimed at gathering data about current conditions and answering questions about the history of Mars. The questions raised by the scientific community are expected to not only give a better appreciation of the Red Planet but also yield further insight into the past, and possible future, of Earth. The exploration of Mars has come at a considerable financial cost with roughly two-thirds of all spacecraft destined for Mars failing before completing their missions, with some failing before they even began. Such a high failure rate can be attributed to the complexity and large number of variables involved in an interplanetary journey, and has led researchers to jokingly speak of The Great Galactic Ghoul [  ] which subsists on a diet of Mars probes. This phenomenon is also informally known as the \" Mars Curse \". [  ] In contrast to overall high failure rates in the exploration of Mars, India has become the first country to achieve success of its maiden attempt. India's Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM) [  ] [  ] [  ] is one of the least expensive interplanetary missions ever undertaken with an approximate total cost of ₹  Crore ( US$ million ). [  ] [  ] The first mission to Mars by any Arab country has been taken up by the United Arab Emirates. Called the Emirates Mars Mission , it was launched on  July  and went into orbit around Mars on  February . The uncrewed exploratory probe was named \"Hope Probe\" and was sent to Mars to study its atmosphere in detail. [  ] Phobos [ edit ] Main article: Exploration of Phobos The Russian space mission Fobos-Grunt , which launched on  November , experienced a failure leaving it stranded in low Earth orbit . [  ] It was to begin exploration of the Phobos and Martian circumterrestrial orbit, and study whether the moons of Mars, or at least Phobos, could be a \"trans-shipment point\" for spaceships traveling to Mars. [  ] Asteroids [ edit ] Main article: Exploration of the asteroids Asteroid  Vesta , imaged by the Dawn spacecraft () Until the advent of space travel , objects in the asteroid belt were merely pinpricks of light in even the largest telescopes, their shapes and terrain remaining a mystery. Several asteroids have now been visited by probes, the first of which was Galileo , which flew past two:  Gaspra in , followed by  Ida in . Both of these lay near enough to Galileo' s planned trajectory to Jupiter that they could be visited at acceptable cost. The first landing on an asteroid was performed by the NEAR Shoemaker probe in , following an orbital survey of the object,  Eros . The dwarf planet Ceres and the asteroid  Vesta , two of the three largest asteroids, were visited by NASA's Dawn spacecraft , launched in . Hayabusa was a robotic spacecraft developed by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency to return a sample of material from the small near-Earth asteroid  Itokawa to Earth for further analysis. Hayabusa was launched on  May  and rendezvoused with Itokawa in mid-September . After arriving at Itokawa, Hayabusa studied the asteroid's shape, spin, topography, color, composition, density, and history. In November , it landed on the asteroid twice to collect samples. The spacecraft returned to Earth on  June . Jupiter [ edit ] Main article: Exploration of Jupiter Tupan Patera on Jupiter's moon Io The exploration of Jupiter has consisted solely of a number of automated NASA spacecraft visiting the planet since . A large majority of the missions have been \"flybys\", in which detailed observations are taken without the probe landing or entering orbit; such as in Pioneer and Voyager programs. The Galileo and Juno spacecraft are the only spacecraft to have entered the planet's orbit. As Jupiter is believed to have only a relatively small rocky core and no real solid surface, a landing mission is precluded. Reaching Jupiter from Earth requires a delta-v of . km/s, [  ] which is comparable to the . km/s delta-v needed to reach low Earth orbit. [  ] Fortunately, gravity assists through planetary flybys can be used to reduce the energy required at launch to reach Jupiter, albeit at the cost of a significantly longer flight duration. [  ] Jupiter has  known moons , many of which have relatively little known information about them. Saturn [ edit ] Main article: Exploration of Saturn Saturn has been explored only through uncrewed spacecraft launched by NASA, including one mission ( Cassini–Huygens ) planned and executed in cooperation with other space agencies. These missions consist of flybys in  by Pioneer  , in  by Voyager  , in  by Voyager  and an orbital mission by the Cassini spacecraft, which lasted from  until . Saturn has at least  known moons , although the exact number is debatable since Saturn's rings are made up of vast numbers of independently orbiting objects of varying sizes. The largest of the moons is Titan , which holds the distinction of being the only moon in the Solar System with an atmosphere denser and thicker than that of Earth. Titan holds the distinction of being the only object in the Outer Solar System that has been explored with a lander, the Huygens probe deployed by the Cassini spacecraft. Uranus [ edit ] Main article: Exploration of Uranus The exploration of Uranus has been entirely through the Voyager  spacecraft, with no other visits currently planned. Given its axial tilt of .°, with its polar regions exposed to sunlight or darkness for long periods, scientists were not sure what to expect at Uranus. The closest approach to Uranus occurred on  January . Voyager  studied the planet's unique atmosphere and magnetosphere . Voyager  also examined its ring system and the moons of Uranus including all five of the previously known moons, while discovering an additional ten previously unknown moons. Images of Uranus proved to have a uniform appearance, with no evidence of the dramatic storms or atmospheric banding evident on Jupiter and Saturn. Great effort was required to even identify a few clouds in the images of the planet. The magnetosphere of Uranus, however, proved to be unique, being profoundly affected by the planet's unusual axial tilt. In contrast to the bland appearance of Uranus itself, striking images were obtained of the Moons of Uranus, including evidence that Miranda had been unusually geologically active. Neptune [ edit ] Main article: Exploration of Neptune The exploration of Neptune began with the  August  Voyager  flyby, the sole visit to the system as of . The possibility of a Neptune Orbiter has been discussed, but no other missions have been given serious thought. Although the extremely uniform appearance of Uranus during Voyager  ' s visit in  had led to expectations that Neptune would also have few visible atmospheric phenomena, the spacecraft found that Neptune had obvious banding, visible clouds, auroras , and even a conspicuous anticyclone storm system rivaled in size only by Jupiter's Great Red Spot . Neptune also proved to have the fastest winds of any planet in the Solar System, measured as high as , km/h. [  ] Voyager  also examined Neptune's ring and moon system . It discovered  complete rings and additional partial ring \"arcs\" around Neptune. In addition to examining Neptune's three previously known moons, Voyager  also discovered five previously unknown moons, one of which, Proteus , proved to be the last largest moon in the system. Data from Voyager  supported the view that Neptune's largest moon, Triton , is a captured Kuiper belt object. [  ] Pluto [ edit ] Main article: Pluto § Exploration The dwarf planet Pluto presents significant challenges for spacecraft because of its great distance from Earth (requiring high velocity for reasonable trip times) and small mass (making capture into orbit difficult at present). Voyager  could have visited Pluto, but controllers opted instead for a close flyby of Saturn's moon Titan, resulting in a trajectory incompatible with a Pluto flyby. Voyager  never had a plausible trajectory for reaching Pluto. [  ] After an intense political battle, a mission to Pluto dubbed New Horizons was granted funding from the United States government in . [  ] New Horizons was launched successfully on  January . In early  the craft made use of a gravity assist from Jupiter . Its closest approach to Pluto was on  July ; scientific observations of Pluto began five months prior to closest approach and continued for  days after the encounter. Kuiper Belt Objects [ edit ] The New Horizons mission also performed a flyby of the small planetesimal Arrokoth , in the Kuiper belt , in . This was its first extended mission. [  ] Comets [ edit ] Main article: List of missions to comets Comet P/Hartley () Although many comets have been studied from Earth sometimes with centuries-worth of observations, only a few comets have been closely visited. In , the International Cometary Explorer conducted the first comet fly-by ( P/Giacobini-Zinner ) before joining the Halley Armada studying the famous comet. The Deep Impact probe smashed into P/Tempel to learn more about its structure and composition and the Stardust mission returned samples of another comet's tail. The Philae lander successfully landed on Comet Churyumov–Gerasimenko in  as part of the broader Rosetta mission . Deep space exploration [ edit ] Main article: Deep space exploration This high-resolution image of the Hubble Ultra Deep Field includes galaxies of various ages, sizes, shapes, and colors. The smallest, reddest galaxies, are some of the most distant galaxies to have been imaged by an optical telescope. Deep space exploration is the branch of astronomy , astronautics and space technology that is involved with the exploration of distant regions of outer space. [  ] Physical exploration of space is conducted both by human spaceflights (deep-space astronautics) and by robotic spacecraft . Some of the best candidates for future deep space engine technologies include anti-matter , nuclear power and beamed propulsion . [  ] Beamed propulsion, appears to be the best candidate for deep space exploration presently available, since it uses known physics and known technology that is being developed for other purposes. [  ] Future of space exploration [ edit ] Main article: Future of space exploration Concept art for a NASA Vision mission Artistic image of a rocket lifting from a Saturn moon Breakthrough Starshot [ edit ] Main article: Breakthrough Starshot Breakthrough Starshot is a research and engineering project by the Breakthrough Initiatives to develop a proof-of-concept fleet of light sail spacecraft named StarChip , [  ] to be capable of making the journey to the Alpha Centauri star system . light-years away. It was founded in  by Yuri Milner , Stephen Hawking , and Mark Zuckerberg . [  ] [  ] Asteroids [ edit ] Main article: Exploration of the asteroids An article in the science magazine Nature suggested the use of asteroids as a gateway for space exploration, with the ultimate destination being Mars. In order to make such an approach viable, three requirements need to be fulfilled: first, \"a thorough asteroid survey to find thousands of nearby bodies suitable for astronauts to visit\"; second, \"extending flight duration and distance capability to ever-increasing ranges out to Mars\"; and finally, \"developing better robotic vehicles and tools to enable astronauts to explore an asteroid regardless of its size, shape or spin\". Furthermore, using asteroids would provide astronauts with protection from galactic cosmic rays, with mission crews being able to land on them without great risk to radiation exposure. Artemis program [ edit ] Main article: Artemis program The Artemis program is an ongoing crewed spaceflight program carried out by NASA , U.S. commercial spaceflight companies , and international partners such as ESA , [  ] with the goal of landing \"the first woman and the next man\" on the Moon, specifically at the lunar south pole region. Artemis would be the next step towards the long-term goal of establishing a sustainable presence on the Moon, laying the foundation for private companies to build a lunar economy, and eventually sending humans to Mars . In , the lunar campaign was authorized by Space Policy Directive  , using various ongoing spacecraft programs such as Orion , the Lunar Gateway , Commercial Lunar Payload Services , and adding an undeveloped crewed lander. The Space Launch System will serve as the primary launch vehicle for Orion, while commercial launch vehicles are planned for use to launch other elements of the campaign. [  ] NASA requested $. billion in additional funding for Artemis for fiscal year , [  ] while the U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee requested from NASA a five-year budget profile [  ] which is needed for evaluation and approval by the U.S. Congress . [  ] [  ] As of , the first Artemis mission was launched in  with the second mission, a crewed lunar flyby planned for . [  ] Construction on the Lunar Gateway is underway with initial capabilities set for the – timeframe. [  ] The first CLPS lander landed in , marking the first US spacecraft to land since Apollo  . [  ] Rationales [ edit ] Main article: Space advocacy Astronaut Buzz Aldrin had a personal Communion service when he first arrived on the surface of the Moon . The research that is conducted by national space exploration agencies, such as NASA and Roscosmos , is one of the reasons supporters cite to justify government expenses. Economic analyses of the NASA programs often showed ongoing economic benefits (such as NASA spin-offs ), generating many times the revenue of the cost of the program. [  ] It is also argued that space exploration would lead to the extraction of resources on other planets and especially asteroids, which contain billions of dollars worth of minerals and metals. Such expeditions could generate substantial revenue. [  ] In addition, it has been argued that space exploration programs help inspire youth to study in science and engineering. [  ] Space exploration also gives scientists the ability to perform experiments in other settings and expand humanity's knowledge. [  ] Another claim is that space exploration is a necessity to humankind and that staying on Earth will eventually lead to extinction . Some of the reasons are lack of natural resources, comets, nuclear war, and worldwide epidemic. Stephen Hawking , renowned British theoretical physicist, said, \"I don't think the human race will survive the next thousand years, unless we spread into space. There are too many accidents that can befall life on a single planet. But I'm an optimist. We will reach out to the stars.\" [  ] Author Arthur C. Clarke () presented a summary of motivations for the human exploration of space in his non-fiction semi-technical monograph Interplanetary Flight . [  ] He argued that humanity's choice is essentially between expansion off Earth into space, versus cultural (and eventually biological) stagnation and death. These motivations could be attributed to one of the first rocket scientists in NASA, Wernher von Braun , and his vision of humans moving beyond Earth. The basis of this plan was to: Develop multi-stage rockets capable of placing satellites, animals, and humans in space. Development of large, winged reusable spacecraft capable of carrying humans and equipment into Earth orbit in a way that made space access routine and cost-effective. Construction of a large, permanently occupied space station to be used as a platform both to observe Earth and from which to launch deep space expeditions. Launching the first human flights around the Moon, leading to the first landings of humans on the Moon, with the intent of exploring that body and establishing permanent lunar bases. Assembly and fueling of spaceships in Earth orbit for the purpose of sending humans to Mars with the intent of eventually colonizing that planet. [  ] Known as the Von Braun Paradigm, the plan was formulated to lead humans in the exploration of space. Von Braun's vision of human space exploration served as the model for efforts in space exploration well into the twenty-first century, with NASA incorporating this approach into the majority of their projects. [  ] The steps were followed out of order, as seen by the Apollo program reaching the moon before the space shuttle program was started, which in turn was used to complete the International Space Station. Von Braun's Paradigm formed NASA's drive for human exploration, in the hopes that humans discover the far reaches of the universe. NASA has produced a series of public service announcement videos supporting the concept of space exploration. [  ] Overall, the U.S. public remains largely supportive of both crewed and uncrewed space exploration. According to an Associated Press Poll conducted in July , % of U.S. citizens agreed with the statement that the space program is \"a good investment\", compared to % who did not. [  ] Human nature [ edit ] Space advocacy and space policy [  ] regularly invokes exploration as a human nature . [  ] Topics [ edit ] Main articles: Space science and Human presence in space Spaceflight [ edit ] Main articles: Spaceflight and Astronautics Delta-v's in km/s for various orbital maneuvers Spaceflight is the use of space technology to achieve the flight of spacecraft into and through outer space. Spaceflight is used in space exploration, and also in commercial activities like space tourism and satellite telecommunications . Additional non-commercial uses of spaceflight include space observatories , reconnaissance satellites and other Earth observation satellites . A spaceflight typically begins with a rocket launch , which provides the initial thrust to overcome the force of gravity and propels the spacecraft from the surface of Earth. Once in space, the motion of a spacecraft—both when unpropelled and when under propulsion—is covered by the area of study called astrodynamics . Some spacecraft remain in space indefinitely, some disintegrate during atmospheric reentry , and others reach a planetary or lunar surface for landing or impact. Satellites [ edit ] Main article: Satellite Satellites are used for a large number of purposes. Common types include military (spy) and civilian Earth observation satellites, communication satellites, navigation satellites, weather satellites, and research satellites. Space stations and human spacecraft in orbit are also satellites. Commercialization of space [ edit ] Main article: Commercialization of space The commercialization of space first started out with the launching of private satellites by NASA or other space agencies. Current examples of the commercial satellite use of space include satellite navigation systems , satellite television, satellite communications (such as internet services) and satellite radio . The next step of commercialization of space was seen as human spaceflight. Flying humans safely to and from space had become routine to NASA and Russia. [  ] Reusable spacecraft were an entirely new engineering challenge, something only seen in novels and films like Star Trek and War of the Worlds. Astronaut Buzz Aldrin supported the use of making a reusable vehicle like the space shuttle. Aldrin held that reusable spacecraft were the key in making space travel affordable, stating that the use of \"passenger space travel is a huge potential market big enough to justify the creation of reusable launch vehicles\". [  ] Space tourism is a next step in the use of reusable vehicles in the commercialization of space. The purpose of this form of space travel is personal pleasure. Private spaceflight companies such as SpaceX and Blue Origin , and commercial space stations such as the Axiom Space and the Bigelow Commercial Space Station have changed the cost and overall landscape of space exploration, and are expected to continue to do so in the near future. Alien life [ edit ] Main articles: Astrobiology and Extraterrestrial life Astrobiology is the interdisciplinary study of life in the universe, combining aspects of astronomy , biology and geology. [  ] It is focused primarily on the study of the origin , distribution and evolution of life. It is also known as exobiology (from Greek: έξω, exo , \"outside\"). [  ] [  ] [  ] The term \"Xenobiology\" has been used as well, but this is technically incorrect because its terminology means \"biology of the foreigners\". [  ] Astrobiologists must also consider the possibility of life that is chemically entirely distinct from any life found on Earth. [  ] In the Solar System, some of the prime locations for current or past astrobiology are on Enceladus, Europa, Mars, and Titan. [  ] Human spaceflight and habitation [ edit ] Main articles: Human spaceflight , Bioastronautics , Effect of spaceflight on the human body , Space medicine , Space architecture , Space station , Space habitat (facility) , and Space habitat (settlement) Crew quarters on Zvezda , the base ISS crew module To date, the longest human occupation of space is the International Space Station which has been in continuous use for  years,  days. Valeri Polyakov 's record single spaceflight of almost  days aboard the Mir space station has not been surpassed. The health effects of space have been well documented through years of research conducted in the field of aerospace medicine . Analog environments similar to those experienced in space travel (like deep sea submarines), have been used in this research to further explore the relationship between isolation and extreme environments. [  ] It is imperative that the health of the crew be maintained as any deviation from baseline may compromise the integrity of the mission as well as the safety of the crew, hence the astronauts must endure rigorous medical screenings and tests prior to embarking on any missions. However, it does not take long for the environmental dynamics of spaceflight to commence its toll on the human body; for example, space motion sickness (SMS) – a condition which affects the neurovestibular system and culminates in mild to severe signs and symptoms such as vertigo, dizziness, fatigue, nausea, and disorientation – plagues almost all space travelers within their first few days in orbit. [  ] Space travel can also have an impact on the psyche of the crew members as delineated in anecdotal writings composed after their retirement. Space travel can adversely affect the body's natural biological clock ( circadian rhythm ); sleep patterns causing sleep deprivation and fatigue; and social interaction; consequently, residing in a Low Earth Orbit (LEO) environment for a prolonged amount of time can result in both mental and physical exhaustion. [  ] Long-term stays in space reveal issues with bone and muscle loss in low gravity, immune system suppression, problems with eyesight, and radiation exposure. The lack of gravity causes fluid to rise upward which can cause pressure to build up in the eye, resulting in vision problems; the loss of bone minerals and densities; cardiovascular deconditioning; and decreased endurance and muscle mass. [  ] Radiation is an insidious health hazard to space travelers as it is invisible and can cause cancer. When above the Earth's magnetic field, spacecraft are no longer protected from the sun's radiation; the danger of radiation is even more potent in deep space. The hazards of radiation can be ameliorated through protective shielding on the spacecraft, alerts, and dosimetry . [  ] Fortunately, with new and rapidly evolving technological advancements, those in Mission Control are able to monitor the health of their astronauts more closely using telemedicine . One may not be able to completely evade the physiological effects of space flight, but those effects can be mitigated. For example, medical systems aboard space vessels such as the International Space Station (ISS) are well equipped and designed to counteract the effects of lack of gravity and weightlessness; on-board treadmills can help prevent muscle loss and reduce the risk of developing premature osteoporosis . [  ] [  ] Additionally, a crew medical officer is appointed for each ISS mission and a flight surgeon is available / via the ISS Mission Control Center located in Houston, Texas. [  ] Although the interactions are intended to take place in real time, communications between the space and terrestrial crew may become delayed – sometimes by as much as  minutes [  ] – as their distance from each other increases when the spacecraft moves further out of low Earth orbit; because of this the crew are trained and need to be prepared to respond to any medical emergencies that may arise on the vessel as the ground crew are hundreds of miles away. Many past and current concepts for the continued exploration and colonization of space focus on a return to the Moon as a \"steppingstone\" to the other planets, especially Mars. At the end of , NASA announced they were planning to build a permanent Moon base with continual presence by . [  ] Beyond the technical factors that could make living in space more widespread, it has been suggested that the lack of private property , the inability or difficulty in establishing property rights in space, has been an impediment to the development of space for human habitation. Since the advent of space technology in the latter half of the twentieth century, the ownership of property in space has been murky, with strong arguments both for and against. In particular, the making of national territorial claims in outer space and on celestial bodies has been specifically proscribed by the Outer Space Treaty , which had been, as of  [update] , ratified by all spacefaring nations . [  ] Space colonization, also called space settlement and space humanization, would be the permanent autonomous (self-sufficient) human habitation of locations outside Earth, especially of natural satellites or planets such as the Moon or Mars , using significant amounts of in-situ resource utilization . Human representation and participation [ edit ] See also: Space law Participation and representation of humanity in space is an issue ever since the first phase of space exploration. [  ] Some rights of non-spacefaring countries have been mostly secured through international space law , declaring space the \" province of all mankind \", understanding spaceflight as its resource, though sharing of space for all humanity is still criticized as imperialist and lacking. [  ] Additionally to international inclusion, the inclusion of women and people of colour has also been lacking. To reach a more inclusive spaceflight, some organizations like the Justspace Alliance [  ] and IAU featured Inclusive Astronomy [  ] have been formed in recent years. Women [ edit ] Main article: Women in space The first woman to go to space was Valentina Tereshkova . She flew in  but it was not until the s that another woman entered space again. All astronauts were required to be military test pilots at the time and women were not able to join this career. This is one reason for the delay in allowing women to join space crews. [ citation needed ] After the rule changed, Svetlana Savitskaya became the second woman to go to space, she was also from the Soviet Union . Sally Ride became the next woman in space and the first woman to fly to space through the United States program. Since then, eleven other countries have allowed women astronauts. The first all-female space walk occurred in , including Christina Koch and Jessica Meir . They had both previously participated in space walks with NASA. The first woman to go to the Moon is planned for . Despite these developments, women are underrepresented among astronauts and especially cosmonauts. Issues that block potential applicants from the programs, and limit the space missions they are able to go on, include: agencies limiting women to half as much time in space than men, arguing that there may be unresearched additional risks for cancer. [  ] a lack of space suits sized appropriately for female astronauts.

            "Robotic vehicle for Mars surface exploration This article is about autonomous exploration vehicles. For crewed vehicles on Mars, see Crewed Mars rover . NASA's Curiosity rover, selfie ,  A Mars rover is a remote-controlled motor vehicle designed to travel on the surface of Mars . Rovers have several advantages over stationary landers : they examine more territory, they can be directed to interesting features, they can place themselves in sunny positions to weather winter months, and they can advance the knowledge of how to perform very remote robotic vehicle control. They serve a different purpose than orbital spacecraft like Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter . A more recent development is the Mars helicopter . As of May  [update] , there have been six successful robotically operated Mars rovers; the first five, managed by the American NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory , were (by date of Mars landing): Sojourner (), Spirit (–), Opportunity (–), Curiosity (–present), and Perseverance (–present). The sixth, managed by the China National Space Administration , is Zhurong (–). On January , , NASA reported that then current studies on Mars by Opportunity and Curiosity would be searching for evidence of ancient life, including a biosphere based on autotrophic , chemotrophic or chemolithoautotrophic microorganisms , as well as ancient water, including fluvio-lacustrine environments ( plains related to ancient rivers or lakes ) that may have been habitable . [  ] [  ] [  ] [  ] [  ] The search for evidence of habitability , taphonomy (related to fossils ), and organic carbon on Mars is now a primary NASA objective. [  ] [  ] The Soviet probes, Mars  and Mars  , were physically tethered probes; Sojourner was dependent on the Mars Pathfinder base station for communication with Earth; Opportunity , Spirit and Curiosity were on their own. As of November , Curiosity is still active, while Spirit , Opportunity , and Sojourner completed their missions before losing contact. On February , , Perseverance , the newest American Mars rover, successfully landed.  On May , , China's Zhurong became the first non-American rover to successfully operate on Mars. Missions [ edit ] See also: List of missions to Mars Multiple rovers have been dispatched to Mars: Zhurong rover and lander captured by HiRISE from NASA 's MRO on  June  Active [ edit ] Curiosity of the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) mission by NASA, was launched November ,  [  ] [  ] and landed at the Aeolis Palus plain near Aeolis Mons (informally \"Mount Sharp\") [  ] [  ] [  ] [  ] in Gale Crater on August , . [  ] [  ] [  ] The Curiosity rover is still operational as of . Perseverance is NASA's rover based on the successful Curiosity design. Launched with the Mars  mission on July , , it landed on February , . [  ] It carried the Mars helicopter Ingenuity attached to its belly. Although Ingenuity 's mission has ended, Perseverance remains operational as of March . Past [ edit ] Sojourner disembarks Mars Pathfinder base station lander on the surface of planet Mars Sojourner rover, Mars Pathfinder , landed successfully on July , . Communications were lost on September , . Sojourner had traveled a distance of just over  meters ( ft). [  ] Spirit (MER-A), Mars Exploration Rover (MER), launched on June , , [  ] and landed on January , . Nearly six years after the original mission limit, Spirit had covered a total distance of . km (. mi) but its wheels became trapped in sand. [  ] The last communication received from the rover was on March , , and NASA ceased attempts to re-establish communication on May , . [  ] Opportunity (MER-B), Mars Exploration Rover, launched on July ,  [  ] and landed on January , . Opportunity surpassed the previous records for longevity at , sols ( Earth days from landing to mission end;  Earth years or  Martian years) and covered . km (. mi). The rover sent its last status on  June  when a global  Mars dust storm blocked the sunlight needed to recharge its batteries. [  ] After hundreds of attempts to reactivate the rover, NASA declared the mission complete on February , . Zhurong launched with the Tianwen- CNSA Mars mission on July , , landed on May , , in the southern region of Utopia Planitia , and deployed on May , , while dropping a remote selfie camera on  June . [  ] [  ] Designed for a lifespan of  sols ( Earth days), [  ] Zhurong had been active for  sols (. days) since its deployment and traveled on Mars's surface for , m (, ft). [  ] Since  May , the rover was deactivated due to approaching sandstorms and Martian winter. [  ] [  ] But the larger-than-expected build-up of dust covering its solar panels prevented it from self-reactivation. On  April , the mission designer Zhang Rongqiao announced that the buildup of dust from the last inactivation is greater than planned, indicating the rover could be inactive \"forever\". [  ] Failed [ edit ] Mars  , PrOP-M rover, , Mars  landing failed, destroying Prop-M with it. The Mars  and  spacecraft from the Soviet Union had identical . kilograms (. lb) Prop-M rovers. They were to move on skis while connected to the landers with cables. [  ] Mars  , PrOP-M rover, landed successfully on December , . . kilograms (. lb) rover tethered to the Mars  lander. Lost when the Mars  lander stopped communicating about  seconds after landing. [  ] The loss of communication may have been due to the extremely powerful Martian dust storm taking place at the time, or an issue with the Mars  orbiter's ability to relay communications. Planned [ edit ] ESA's ExoMars rover Rosalind Franklin was confirmed technically ready for launch in March  and planned to launch in September , but due to the suspension of cooperation with Roscosmos this is delayed until at least . A fast-track study was started to determine alternative launch options. [  ] The Russian Moscow Aviation Institute and the Indian IIT are jointly developing a fixed-wing Mars UAV which as of March  [update] is scheduled for launch in late . [  ] Proposed [ edit ] The JAXA Melos rover was supposed to be launched in . JAXA has not given an update since . NASA Mars Geyser Hopper ISRO has proposed a Mars rover as part of Mars Lander Mission , its second Mars mission in . [  ] Mars Tumbleweed Rover , a spherical wind-propelled rover. The concept was first investigated by NASA in the early s. [  ] [  ] Since , Team Tumbleweed has been developing a series of Tumbleweed Rovers. The research organization aims to land a swarm of  Tumbleweed rovers on the Martian surface by . [  ] Undeveloped [ edit ] Marsokhod was proposed to be a part of Russian Mars  mission.

NASA distinguishes between \"mission\" objectives and \"science\" objectives. Mission objectives are related to progress in space technology and development processes. Science objectives are met by the instruments during their mission in space. The science instruments are chosen and designed based on the science objectives and goals. The primary goal of the Spirit and Opportunity rovers was to investigate \"the history of water on Mars\". [  ] The four science goals of NASA's long-term Mars Exploration Program are: Determine whether life ever arose on Mars Characterize the climate of Mars Characterize the geology of Mars Prepare for human exploration of Mars [  ] Panorama of Husband Hill taken by the Spirit rover (November ) Gallery [ edit ] Mars rovers Sojourner rover on Mars Comparison of wheels: Mars Sojourner rover, MER, MSL Comparison (): MER, Sojourner rover, MSL Comparison (): MER, Sojourner rover, humans, MSL Opportunity rover later visited its heat shield impact site; it was ejected during the rover's descent and impacted the surface separately.
